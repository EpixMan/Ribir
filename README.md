# Ribir

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-informational)](https://github.com/RibirX/ribir/blob/master/LICENSE)

A declarative, purely composed GUI library for building cross-platform applications. It's lightweight and powerful.

</div>

## Principle

**Only pay for what you need**: Ribir does not have the base object. Everything is purely composed, such as `Margin`. If your application doesn't need `Margin`, you don't pay for `Margin` overhead.

**Only describe your data structure**: In Ribir, the interface is a presentation around the data structure, not interfering with the data structure.

**Auto reactive to data notifies**: Ribir can automatically respond to change reactive when the data relationships are established.

## Features

- Declarative GUI
- Reactive programming
- Multiple built-in widgets
